I'm Michelle, a Filipino-American bioinformatician based in sunny San Diego, California. I love science, reading, and art!

I received my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics & Systems Biology from the University of California, San Diego in 2022, and a B.S. in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics from the same university in 2017.

You can check out some of my projects on GitHub, view my Linkedin, or reach out to me via Email. I'd love to connect sometime!
